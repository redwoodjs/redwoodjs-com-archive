# Webpack Configuration

Redwood uses webpack. And with webpack, comes configuration.

One of Redwood's tenets is convention over configuration. So it's worth repeating that you don't have to do any of this. Take the golden path, and everything will work just fine.

But another of Redwood's tenets is to make the hard stuff possible. Whether Webpack configuration falls into the hard-stuff category or not is up for debate. But one thing we know for sure is it can be an epic time sink. We hope that documenting it well will make this process fast, easy, and maybe even enjoyable.

While configuring webpack, at some point, you may wonder what exactly our configuration is. The following section aims to explain that. But if you just want to configure webpack, jump to [Configuring Webpack](#configuring-webpack).

## Redwood's Webpack Configuration Files

You can find Redwood's webpack config files in `@redwoodjs/core`'s [config](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/tree/master/packages/core/config) directory. 
There's four altogether:

| File                                                                                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [webpack.common.js](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/blob/master/packages/core/config/webpack.common.js)           | Base config; merges with development, production, and user-defined configs                                                                                                         |
| [webpack.development.js](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/blob/master/packages/core/config/webpack.development.js) | Config used when developing locally                                                                                                                                                |
| [webpack.production.js](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/blob/master/packages/core/config/webpack.production.js)   | Config used when building for production                                                                                                                                           |
| [webpack.stat.js](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/blob/master/packages/core/config/webpack.stats.js)              | Config used when `--stats` is provided to `yarn rw build`; merges the production config with [Webpack Bundle Analyzer](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer) |

### webpack.common.js

This is the base config; it merges with the development and production configs, configures options common to both, and merges the user-defined config along the way.

This is where the bulk of the configuration happens. Since we distinguish between a development and production configs, we [do as the docs say](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/configuration-types/#exporting-a-function) and export a function. 

Here's a table of some of the plugins we use:

| Plugin                                                                                             | Description                                                                                |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [HtmlWebpackPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/html-webpack-plugin/)                           | Simplifies the creation of HTML files to serve your webpack bundles                        |
| [DirectoryNamedWebpackPlugin](https://github.com/shaketbaby/directory-named-webpack-plugin#readme) | Makes it possible to control which file in a directory will be treated as the entry file   |
| [MiniCssExtractPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/mini-css-extract-plugin/)                    | Extracts CSS into separate files                                                           |
| [CopyWebpackPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/copy-webpack-plugin/)                           | Copies individual files or entire directories, which already exist, to the build directory |
| [DotenvPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/environment-plugin/#dotenvplugin)                    | Exposes (a subset of) dotenv variables                                                     |

### webpack.development.js

This is the config used when developing locally. `yarn rw dev` starts [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/#using-webpack-dev-server) with this config.

With webpack dev server, files aren't written to disk, so you won't see anything in `dist`. Nor do we do any optimizations.

The main thing to configure here is [devServer](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserveroverlay).
But you can already configure many of its options via `redwood.toml`&mdash;see [App Configuration: redwood.toml](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/app-configuration-redwood-toml).

### webpack.production.js

This is the config used when building for production (`yarn rw build`). There's not much here right now.

### webpack.stat.js

Redwood bundles with `webpack.stat.js` if you provide the `--stats` option to `yarn rw build`:

```
yarn rw build --stats
```

Note that this'll skip building the api side.

This config uses [Webpack Bundle Analyzer](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer). When it finishes, it'll launch an interactive zoomable, _treemap_ in your browser to examine the contents of all your bundles.

### Supported Extensions and Loaders

When a file is imported, Redwood runs one of the following loaders in the following order:

| Order | File                                     | Loader                                                                                        |
| :---: | :--------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1.   | `.md, .test.js, .stories.js`             | null-loader                                                                                   |
|  2.   | `.js, .jsx, .ts., .tsx`                  | babel                                                                                         |
|  3.   | `.css, .scss, .module.css, .module.scss` | sass-loader, css-loader, style-loader. Sass requires `sass-loader` and `sass` to be installed |
|  4.   | `.png, .jpg, .gif`                       | url-loader                                                                                    |
|  5.   | `.svg`                                   | svg-react-loader                                                                              |
|  6.   | `*`                                      | file-loader                                                                                   |

<!-- Source: https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/pull/696 -->
Redwood's webpack configuration [comes with postcss-loader](https://github.com/bjackson/redwood/blob/419a4267d9e0634fc8693a6e1a03d25096c0096a/packages/core/config/webpack.common.js#L68-L79). It's ready to plug in your postcss-loader config, `./web/config/postcss.config.js`:

```javascript
// ./web/config/postcss.config.js

module.exports = {
    plugins: {
        'autoprefixer': {},
    }
}
```

## Configuring Webpack

We've made it easy to get started configuring webpack with the webpack setup command:

```bash
yarn rw setup webpack
```

This command sets up the right file (`webpack.config.js`) in the right place (`web/config`):

```js
// web/config/webpack.config.js

module.exports = (config, { mode }) => {
  if (mode === 'development') {
    // Add dev plugin
  }

  // Add custom rules for your project
  // config.module.rules.push(YOUR_RULE)

  // Add custom plugins for your project
  // config.plugins.push(YOUR_PLUGIN)

  return config
}
```

<!-- Not sure if we should include this yet; it used to be there, but seems a little extraneous now. Leaving it out for the time being -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Note that there's another format you could use; you could export an object:

```js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [{...}]
  }
}
```

Why choose one over another? There's a couple reasons: you can only configure a specific environment (i.e. development, production) using the first format.

If you're adding extras, the second format should work just fine. But by now you're already set up with the first so, unless you feel strongly, just go with that. -->

## Examples

If you've never configured webpack before, here's some Redwood-specific examples to get you started.

### Adding Tailwind CSS

This section is inspired by mdv.io's excellent blog post, [Adding Tailwind CSS to RedwoodJS](https://mdv.io/tailwindcss-in-redwoodjs). Note that the `webpack.config.js` file is no longer necessary since Redwood's webpack configuration now comes with postcss-loader by default (see [Supported Extensions and Loaders](#supported-extensions-and-loaders)). Neither is PurgeCSS, since, as of Tailwind CSS v1.4, it's [built-in](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/tag/v1.4.0).

> **But I need to use Tailwind _right now_**
>
> We hear you! And that's why we made the [Tailwind CSS setup](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/cli-commands#setup) command:
>
> ```bash
> yarn rw setup tailwind
> ```

First, install the development dependencies:

```bash
cd web
yarn add -D postcss-loader tailwindcss autoprefixer
```

As mentioned, we don't have to tell webpack to use postcss-loader. But we do have to configure it:

```bash
mkdir config
touch config/postcss.config.js
```

```javascript
// ./web/config/postcss.config.js

const path = require('path')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require('tailwindcss')(path.resolve(__dirname, '../tailwind.config.js')),
    require('autoprefixer')
  ],
}
```

> **So is `postcss-loader` a rule or a package or a...**
>
> We've used the word "postcss-loader" three times, and it's because there's actually three different things: 1) the postcss-loader "rule" in webpack, which is there by default, 2) the postcss-loader package, and 3) the configuration for the postcss-loader rule, which is what goes in `postcss.config.js`.
> 
> Are you sure you don't want to just use that setup command?

Now, initialize tailwind:

```bash
yarn tailwindcss init
```

This generates the tailwind config file, `tailwind.config.js`. Note that we'd ordinarily move this file to `web/config`, like we did with `postcss.config.js`. But since the Tailwind CSS IntelliSense won't work unless `tailwind.config.js` is in a base directory like `web`, we're just leaving this one here for now.

Next, use the tailwind directives in `web/src/index.css`

```css
/* ./web/src/index.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Optionally, you may also add file types to `purge` in your tailwind config file. This will remove unused tailwind CSS when building for production, reducing your css bundle size.
```javascript
// ./web/tailwind.config.js
  purge: {
    enabled: process.env.NETLIFY || process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
    content: [
      './src/**/*.html',
      './src/**/*.js',
      './src/**/*.jsx',
      './src/**/*.tsx',
      './src/**/*.ts',
    ],
  },
```

And that should be it!

### Enabling Sass

Support for Sass is already configured, so all you have to do is install the development dependencies:

```bash
cd web
yarn add -D sass-loader sass
```

## Webpack Dev Server
Redwood uses [Webpack Dev Server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) for local development. When you run `yarn rw dev`, TOML keys in your `redwood.toml`'s `[web]` table, like `port` and `apiProxyPath`, are used as Dev Server settings, in this case, [devServer.port](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserverport) and [devServer.proxy](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserverproxy) respectively. You can see all the settings used for Redwood dev in [webpack.development.js#L12-L32](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/blob/49c3afecc210709641dd340b974c86251ed207dc/packages/core/config/webpack.development.js#L12-L32)

### Pass settings with `--forward`
While it's possible to override Dev Server config with a file, it's often simpler to pass options with the `yarn rw dev` command using the `--forward` flag. See the [Redwood CLI Doc](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/cli-commands#dev) for help and examples.

> For the full list of Webpack Dev Server options, [see this document](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/).

#### Example: Set Port and Disable Browser Opening
You can override `redwood.toml` settings:
```bash
yarn rw dev --forward="--port=1234 --open=false"
```

This will run your application's Web client on port `1234` and disable automatic browser window opening. 

#### Example: Allow External Host Access
If you're running Redwood in dev mode and try to test your application from an external source (i.e. outside your network), you'll get “Invalid Host Header”.  To enable this workflow, you can run the following:
```bash
yarn rw dev --forward="--disable-host-check --host 0.0.0.0 --public example.company.com"
```

This runs the application and forwards to `example.company.com`.
