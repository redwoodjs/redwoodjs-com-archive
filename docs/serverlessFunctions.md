Redwood looks for serverless functions in `api/src/functions`. Each function is mapped to a URI based on its filename. For example, you can find `api/src/functions/graphql.js` at `http://localhost:8911/graphql`.

## Creating Serverless Functions

Creating serverless functions is easy with Redwood's function generator:

```terminal
yarn rw g function <name>
```

It'll give you a stub that exports a handler that returns a status code&mdash;the bare minimum you need to get going: 

```js
export const handler = async (event, context) => {
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({
      data: '${name} function',
    }),
  }
}
```

## The handler

For a lambda function to be a lambda function, it must export a handler that returns a status code. The handler receives two arguments: `event` and `context`. Whatever it returns is the `response`, which should include a `statusCode` at the very least.

Note that you can use code in `api/src` in your serverless function, such as importing the `db` from `src/lib/db`.

## Developing locally

When you're developing locally, the dev server watches the `api` directory for modifications; when it detects any, it re-imports all the modules.

## Security considerations

When deployed, a custom serverless function is an open API endpoint and is your responsibility to secure appropriately.

That means that that anyone can access your function and perform any tasks it's asked to do. In many cases, this is completely appropriate and desired behavior. 

But, in some cases, for example when the function interacts with third parties, like sending email, or when it retrieves sensitive information from a database, you may want to ensure that only verified requests from trusted sources can invoke your function.

And, in some other cases, you may even want to limit how often the function is called over s set period of time to avoid denial-of-service-type attacks.
