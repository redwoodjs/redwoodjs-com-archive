# Role-based Access Control (RBAC)

Role-based access control (RBAC) in RedwoodJS aims to be a simple, manageable approach to access management. It adds control over who can access routes, see features, or invoke services or functions to the existing `useAuth()` hook on the web side and `requireAuth()` helper on the api side.

A **role** is a collection of permissions applied to a set of users based on the part they play in an organization or setting. Using roles makes it easier to add, remove, and adjust these permissions as your user base increases in scale and functionality increases in complexity.

This cookbook examines how RBAC is implemented in RedwoodJS and <a href="#how-to-code-examples" data-turbolinks="false">how to protect</a> areas of your app's sides -- web, api, or custom.

## Authentication vs Authorization

How is Authorization different from Authentication?

- **Authentication** is the act of validating that users are who they claim to be.
- **Authorization** is the process of giving the user permission to access a specific resource or function.

In even more simpler terms authentication is the _process_ of verifying oneself, while authorization is the _process_ of verifying what you have access to.

### House and Blog Role-access Examples

When thinking about security, it helps to think in terms of familiar examples.

Let's consider one from the physical world -- access to the various rooms of a 🏠 house -- and compare it to a digital example of a Blog.

#### RBAC Example: House

Consider a 🏠 while you are away on vacation.

You are the **_owner_** and have given out 🔑 keys to your **neighbor** and a **plumber** that unlock the 🏠 🚪 door.

You've assigned them passcodes to turn off the 🚨 alarm that identifies them as either a neighbor or plumber.

Your neighbor can enter the kitchen to get food to feed your 😸 and the your office to water your 🌵 and also use the 🚽.

The plumber can access the basement to get at the pipes, use the 🚽, access the laundry or 🍴 kitchen to fix the sink, but not your office.

Neither of them should be allowed into your 🛏 bedroom.

The owner knows who they claim to be and has given them keys.

The passcodes inform what access they have because it says if they are a neighbor or plumber.

If your 🏠 could enforce RBAC, it needs to know the rules.

#### Role Matrix for House RBAC

| Role     | Kitchen | Basement | Office | Bathroom | Laundry | Bedroom |
| -------- | :-----: | :------: | :----: | :------: | :-----: | :-----: |
| Neighbor |   ✅    |          |   ✅   |    ✅    |         |         |
| Plumber  |   ✅    |    ✅    |        |    ✅    |   ✅    |         |
| Owner    |   ✅    |    ✅    |   ✅   |    ✅    |   ✅    |         |

#### RBAC Example: Blog

In our Blog example anyone can view Posts (authenticated or not). They are _public_.

- Authors can write new Posts.
- Editors can update them.
- Publishers can write, review, edit and delete Posts.
- And admins can do it all (and more).

#### Role Matrix for Blog RBAC

| Role      | View | New | Edit | Delete | Manage Users |
| --------- | :--: | :-: | :--: | :----: | :----------: |
| Author    |  ✅  | ✅  |      |        |              |
| Editor    |  ✅  |     |  ✅  |        |              |
| Publisher |  ✅  | ✅  |  ✅  |   ✅   |              |
| Admin     |  ✅  | ✅  |  ✅  |   ✅   |      ✅      |

## Auth and RBAC Checklist

In order to integrate RBAC in a RedwoodJS app, you will have to:

- Implement an Identity as a Service/Authentication Provider
- Define and Assign Roles
- Set Roles to Current User
- Enforce Access
- Secure Web and Api sides

Helps to be familiar with [Blog Tutorial](https://redwoodjs.com/tutorial/welcome-to-redwood) as well as pages, cells, services, authentication, and routes.

## Identity as a Service

> "Doing authentication correctly is as hard, error-prone, and risky as rolling your own encryption."

Developers no longer need to be responsible for developing their own identity service. The identity service manages authentication and the complexity associated.

RedwoodJS generates Authentication Providers for several common Identity Services.

Some offer RBAC support natively together with a UI to manage users and role assignment.

- Netlify Identity
- Auth0

In other cases, you can still use an Identity Service such as:

- Magic.link
- Custom

However, in these cases you must provide the `currentUser.roles` information directly, such as from a User to Role database table or other source.

### Netlify Identity Access Token (JWT) & App Metadata

The following is a brief example of a **decoded** JSON Web Token (JWT) similar to that issued by Netlify Identity.

There are the following standard claims:

- `exp`: When the token expires.
- `sub`: The token's subject, in this case the user identifier.

Other common claims are `iss` for issuer and `aud` for audience (ie, the recipient for which the JWT is intended).

Please see [Introduction to JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction/) for a complete discussion.

This decoded token also includes:

- `app_metadata`: Stores information (such as, support plan subscriptions, security roles, or access control groups) that can impact a user's core functionality, such as how an application functions or what the user can access. Data stored in app_metadata cannot be edited by users
- `user_metadata`: Stores user attributes such as preferences that do not impact a user's core functionality. Logged in users can edit their data stored in user_metadata typically by making an api call the Identity service user profile endpoint with their access_token to identify themselves.

Roles may be stored within `app_metadata` or sometimes within `authorization` under `app_metadata`.

```js
{
  "exp": 1598628532,
  "sub": "1d271db5-f0cg-21f4-8b43-a01ddd3be294",
  "email": "example+author@example.com",
  "app_metadata": {
    "roles": ["author"]
  },
  "user_metadata": {
    "full_name": "Arthur Author",
  }
}
```

## How To Code Examples

### Set Roles to Current User

Roles may be stored within `app_metadata` or sometimes within `authorization` under `app_metadata`.

The `parseJWT` helper will consider both locations to extract roles on the decoded JWT.

```js
// api/lib/auth.js

import { parseJWT } from '@redwoodjs/api'

export const getCurrentUser = async (decoded) => {
  return context.currentUser || { ...decoded, roles: parseJWT({ decoded }).roles }
}
```

#### Roles from a Database

If your AuthProvider does not set the role information in the token, you can query roles from a database table.

Consider the following schema where a `User` has many `UserRoles`.

```js
model User {
  id        Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
  uuid      String     @unique
  createdAt DateTime   @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime   @default(now())
  userRoles UserRole[]
}

model UserRole {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @default(now())
  name      String
  user      User?    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId    Int?

  @@unique([name, userId])
}
```

You can have seeded the `User` and `UserRole` tables with a new User that has a `uuid` from your identity service and also assigned that user a role of `editor`:

```js
const uuid = '1683d760-5b4d-2ced-a078-23fdfebe2e19'

const newUser = await db.user.create({
  data: { uuid },
})

const userRole = await db.userRole.create({
  data: {
    name: 'editor',
    user: {
      connect: { uuid },
    },
  },
})
```

Given that your decoded JWT `sub` claim will contain the `uuid`, you can fetch the roles by querying the `UserRoles` table and join in on the `User` via its `uuid`.

Once you have the `UserRole`s, then you can set an array of their `name`s on the `currentUser`.

```js
// api/lib/auth.js

export const getCurrentUser = async (decoded) => {
  const userRoles = await db.userRole.findMany({
    where: { user: { uuid: decoded.sub } },
    select: { name: true },
  })

  const roles = userRoles.map((role) => {
    return role.name
  })

  return context.currentUser || { roles }
}
```

### Web-side RBAC

- useAuth() hook
- hasRole also checks if authenticated.

* Routes
* NavLinks in a Layout
* Cells/Components
* Markup in Page

#### How to Protect a Route

To protect a `Private` route for access by a single role:

```js
import { Router, Route, Private } from '@redwoodjs/router'

const Routes = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Private unauthenticated="home" role="admin">
        <Route path="/admin/users" page={UsersPage} name="users" />
      </Private>
    </Router>
  )
}
```

To protect a `Private` route for access by a multiple roles:

```js
import { Router, Route, Private } from '@redwoodjs/router'

const Routes = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Private unauthenticated="home" role={['admin', 'editor', 'publisher']}>
        <Route path="/admin/posts/{id:Int}/edit" page={EditPostPage} name="editPost" />
      </Private>
    </Router>
  )
}
```

If the currentUser is not assigned the role, they will be redirected to the page specified in the `unauthenticated` property. Therefore, you can define a specific page to be seen when attempting to access the protected route and denied access such as a "forbidden" page:

```js
import { Router, Route, Private } from '@redwoodjs/router'

const Routes = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Private unauthenticated="forbidden" role="admin">
        <Route path="/settings" page={SettingsPage} name="settings" />
        <Route path="/admin" page={AdminPage} name="sites" />
      </Private>

      <Route notfound page={NotFoundPage} />
      <Route path="/forbidden" page={ForbiddenPage} name="forbidden" />
    </Router>
  )
}
```

#### How to Protect a NavLink in a Layout

A `NavLink` is a specialized `Link` used for navigation or menu links that is styled differently when the current route is active.

To protect the `NavLink` for access by a single role:

```js
import { NavLink, Link, routes } from '@redwoodjs/router'
import { useAuth } from '@redwoodjs/auth'

const SidebarLayout = ({ children }) => {
  const { hasRole } = useAuth()

  return (
    ...
    {hasRole('admin') && (
      <NavLink
        to={routes.users()} className="text-gray-600" activeClassName="text-gray-900"
      >
      Manage Users
    </NavLink>
    ...
   )}
 )
}
```

To protect the `NavLink` for access by multiple roles:

```js
import { NavLink, Link, routes } from '@redwoodjs/router'
import { useAuth } from '@redwoodjs/auth'

const SidebarLayout = ({ children }) => {
  const { hasRole } = useAuth()

  return (
    ...
    {hasRole(['admin', 'author', 'editor', 'publisher']) && (
      <NavLink
        to={routes.posts()} className="text-gray-600" activeClassName="text-gray-900"
      >
      Manage Posts
    </NavLink>
    ...
   )}
 )
}
```

Note that `hasRole()` also checks if the currentUser is authenticated.

#### How to Protect a Component

To protect content in a `Component` for access by a single role:

```js
import { useAuth } from '@redwoodjs/auth'

const Post = ({ post }) => {
  const { hasRole } = useAuth()

  return (
    <nav className="rw-button-group">
      {(hasRole('admin')) && (
          <a href="#" className="rw-button rw-button-red" onClick={() => onDeleteClick(post.id)}>
            Delete
          </a>
        ))}
    </nav>
  )
}
```

To protect content in a `Component` for access by multiple roles:

```js
import { useAuth } from '@redwoodjs/auth'

const Post = ({ post }) => {
  const { hasRole } = useAuth()

  return (
    <nav className="rw-button-group">
      {(hasRole(['admin', 'publisher'])) && (
          <a href="#" className="rw-button rw-button-red" onClick={() => onDeleteClick(post.id)}>
            Delete
          </a>
        ))}
    </nav>
  )
}
```

Note that `hasRole()` also checks if the currentUser is authenticated.

#### How to Protect Markup in a Page

To protect markup in a `Page` for access by a single role:

```js
import { useAuth } from "@redwoodjs/auth";
import SidebarLayout from "src/layouts/SidebarLayout";

const SettingsPage = () => {
  const { isAuthenticated, userMetadata, hasRole } = useAuth();

  return (
    {isAuthenticated && (
      <div className="ml-4 flex-shrink-0">
        {hasRole("admin") && (
          <a
            href={`https://app.netlify.com/sites/${process.env.SITE_NAME}/identity/${userMetadata.id}`}
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
          >
            Edit on Netlify
          </a>
        )}
      </div>
    )}
  )}
}
```

To protect markup in a `Page` for access by multiple roles:

```js
import { useAuth } from "@redwoodjs/auth";
import SidebarLayout from "src/layouts/SidebarLayout";

const SettingsPage = () => {
  const { isAuthenticated, userMetadata, hasRole } = useAuth();

  return (
    {isAuthenticated && (
      <div className="ml-4 flex-shrink-0">
        {hasRole(["admin", "userManager"]) && (
          <a
            href={`https://app.netlify.com/sites/${process.env.SITE_NAME}/identity/${userMetadata.id}`}
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
          >
            Edit on Netlify
          </a>
        )}
      </div>
    )}
  )}
}
```

Note that `hasRole()` also checks if the currentUser is authenticated.

### Api-side RBAC

- Example `requireAuth()`
- Services
- Functions
- Default Roles using [Netlify Identity Triggers](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/trigger-on-events/)

#### Example `requireAuth()`

Use `requireAuth()` in your services to check that a user is logged in, whether or not they are assigned a role, and optionally raise an error if they're not.

It checks for a single role:

```js
requireAuth({ role: 'editor' })
```

or multiple roles:

```js
requireAuth({ role: ['admin', 'author', 'publisher'] })
```

This function should be located in `api/src/lib/auth.js` for your RedwoodJS app (ie, where your `getCurrentUser()` is located).

```js
/**
 * Use requireAuth in your services to check that a user is logged in,
 * whether or not they are assigned a role, and optionally raise an
 * error if they're not.
 *
 * @param {string=} roles - An optional role or list of roles
 * @param {array=} roles - An optional list of roles

 * @example
 *
 * // checks if currentUser is authenticated
 * requireAuth()
 *
 * @example
 *
 * // checks if currentUser is authenticated and assigned one of the given roles
 * requireAuth({ roles: 'admin' })
 * requireAuth({ roles: 'admin' })
 */
export const requireAuth = ({ roles } = {}) => {
  if (!context.currentUser) {
    throw new AuthenticationError("You don't have permission to do that.")
  }

  if (typeof roles !== 'undefined' && typeof roles === 'string' && !context.currentUser.roles?.includes(roles)) {
    throw new ForbiddenError("You don't have access to do that.")
  }

  if (
    typeof roles !== 'undefined' &&
    Array.isArray(roles) &&
    !context.currentUser.roles?.some((role) => roles.includes(role))
  ) {
    throw new ForbiddenError("You don't have access to do that.")
  }
}
```

#### How to Protect a Service

```js
import { db } from 'src/lib/db'
import { requireAuth } from 'src/lib/auth'

const CREATE_POST_ROLES = ['admin', 'author', 'publisher']

export const createPost = ({ input }) => {
  requireAuth({ role: CREATE_POST_ROLES })

  return db.post.create({
    data: {
      ...input,
      authorId: context.currentUser.sub,
      publisherId: context.currentUser.sub,
    },
  })
}
```

#### How to Protect a Function

Since `requireAuth()` raises an exception, catch and return a `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` or `HTTP 403 Forbidden` client error status response code.

```js
import { requireAuth } from 'src/lib/auth'
import { AuthenticationError, ForbiddenError } from '@redwoodjs/api'

export const handler = async (event, context) => {
  try {
    requireAuth({ role: 'admin' })

    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify({
        data: 'Permitted',
      }),
    }
  } catch (e) {
    if (e instanceof AuthenticationError) {
      return {
        statusCode: 401,
      }
    } else if (e instanceof ForbiddenError) {
      return {
        statusCode: 403,
      }
    } else {
      return {
        statusCode: 400,
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### How to Default Roles on Signup using Netlify Identity Triggers

You can trigger serverless function calls when certain Identity events happen, like when a user signs up.

Netlify Identity currently supports the following events:

- `identity-validate`: Triggered when an Identity user tries to sign up via Identity.
- `identity-signup`: Triggered when an Identity user signs up via Netlify Identity. (Note: this fires for only email+password signups, not for signups via external providers e.g. Google/GitHub)
- `identity-login`: Triggered when an Identity user logs in via Netlify Identity

To set a serverless function to trigger on one of these events, match the name of the function file to the name of the event. For example, to trigger a serverless function on identity-signup events, name the function file `identity-signup.js`.

If you return a status other than 200 or 204 from one of these event functions, the signup or login will be blocked.

If your serverless function returns a 200, you can also return a JSON object with new user_metadata or app_metadata for the Identity user.

```js
// api/src/functions/identity-signup.js

export const handler = async (req, _context) => {
  const body = JSON.parse(req.body)

  const eventType = body.event
  const user = body.user
  const email = user.email

  let roles = []

  if (eventType === 'signup') {
    if (email.includes('+author')) {
      roles.push('author')
    }

    if (email.includes('+editor')) {
      roles.push('editor')
    }

    if (email.includes('+publisher')) {
      roles.push('publisher')
    }

    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify({ app_metadata: { roles: roles } }),
    }
  } else {
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
    }
  }
}
```
