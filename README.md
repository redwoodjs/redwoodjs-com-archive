# redwoodjs.com

This is the repo for https://redwoodjs.com

The content for the tutorial is pulled from TUTORIAL.md in this repo.

Other documentation is pulled from various READMEs in the main [redwoodjs/redwood](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood) repo (see `lib/build.js`, the `SECTIONS` constant).

## Local Development

This codebase is built with https://cameronjs.com and relies on plain HTML pages and Javascript with a couple helpers built in to abstract things like partials and layouts. We use https://stimulusjs.org for the few sprinkles of interactivity throughout the site.

Then build the tutorial and doc pages (after you've installed all dependencies with `yarn install`):

    yarn build

And to develop locally (you'll need to run `yarn build` once first in order to generate some of the navigation menus):

    yarn dev

If you are already running a `yarn dev` process, when you `yarn build`, you may need to stop and start `yarn dev` to pick up the new pages properly.
