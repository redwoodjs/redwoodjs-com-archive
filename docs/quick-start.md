# Quick Start

Yarn is required to create a basic structure. (node: ">=12", yarn: ">=1.15")
```
  yarn create redwood-app ./redwoodblog
```
Start the development server
```cd redwoodblog
    yarn redwood dev
```
A browser should automatically open to http://localhost:8910 and you will see the Redwood welcome page.
